  "Soobeen Woo is a digital media artist exploring unseen layers of perception and existence. Her work translates what escapes human vision—micro-vibrations, disappearing traces, erased voices, and non-human sensory structures—into sound, ceramics, vibration systems, text, and virtual environments, revealing forms of reality that precede interpretation.",
  "Rather than reproducing an entity, her installations focus on the residue and fractures that existence leaves behind. Elements such as heat, breath, fragments, collisions, condensation, and sound operate like living organisms within the work, shifting and fading in response to the viewer's proximity, body heat, air movement, and time.",
  "She critically examines the relationship between perception and existence, engaging questions of the right not to be sensed, the materiality of human emotion as intrusion, and the ways invisible beings come to inhabit the world."

    projectType: 'Individual Project',
    category: 'Performance',

    description: `For a long time, humans have understood perception as a tool to comprehend the world. Only what can be seen, heard, or felt was considered to exist, and perception was used as a means to collect, control, and categorize information. Yet, sensations that are unseen, unheard, and untouchable also operate and exist within the world.

《Autopsy of Sensing》 explores this gap, based on repeated encounters in New Zealand with the deaths of birds—particularly those resulting from collisions with windows—and on the non-visual sensory structures of kiwi and kakapo.

I sonified texts, images, collision data, and photos of the objects using Ableton and Max for Live, and the resulting output is realized as vibrations through two resonating objects: one ceramic and one glass. Each object alludes to the dissected structure of a dead bird, functioning not as a mere reproduction but as a sensory organ that produces distinct resonances.

The vibrations are generated via bone conductor transducers and amplifiers, not to convey messages or meaning, but to remain as fragments of sensation, ghosts of perception that persist even after disappearance.

I unfold the deconstruction and afterlife of sensation through the vibrations and sounds of the two objects, which the audience witnesses but cannot fully interpret. This work records what remains after sensation has vanished—the ghost of perception—and serves as an act of mourning the disappearance and residue of existence.`,

    description: `Resonair explores the interplay between breath, presence, and disappearance in an environment saturated with air pollution. At the center of a round wooden table lies a single mask, surrounded by eight others, all connected by glowing fiber optic cables. Each mask emits light and steam, gradually filling the space with a dense, foggy atmosphere.

A microphone hangs from the ceiling, inviting visitors to interact. When a breath is blown into it, the light shifts—changing slowly from red to blue. This transformation symbolizes the shared nature of breath and the possibility of regeneration through connection. Even when something is broken or fragmented, it can be restored through relational and social bonds.

Breathing is something we do without conscious awareness, which often leads us to forget how precious it is. Through engaging with the installation via breath, this unconscious act is brought to the surface, transforming what is usually invisible and taken for granted into something felt, seen, and shared.

By rendering breath both as a fleeting trace and an act of survival, Resonair blurs the boundary between visibility and erasure. It reminds us that breath, though invisible, must not be taken for granted—and that ignoring air pollution is ignoring the very basis of our existence.`,

    description: `Afropolik is a kinetic installation that addresses air pollution and the right to breathe. The movement of the motor varies depending on real-time air pollution data, influencing the pressure of a face-like form onto a silicone mat.

Higher pollutant levels intensify the movement, creating deeper imprints, while cleaner air results in lighter or no traces. These imprints serve as physical records of the invisible air quality, visualizing the impact of pollution on the human body.

By combining mechanical movement and sound, the work alludes to a future where air is controlled and questions the value and social significance of shared breathing space.`,

    description: `This advertisement for Antio Co., a virtual company, is set within the Antio universe, where hidden agendas and corporate propaganda shape reality. Generated using Pika, Sora, and Suno, and edited with After Effects and Ableton Live, the video adopts a creepy and conspiratorial tone, gradually revealing unsettling truths beneath its polished marketing.

Presented in the style of a dystopian infomercial with VHS aesthetics, the ad showcases Antio's latest innovations, such as Oensa Ant and Perotox, as essential solutions for a controlled future. However, as the narrative unfolds, glitches, distortions, and eerie undertones expose a deeper deception, suggesting that the world outside Antio's promises may not be as habitable as it seems.

The sound design, featuring manipulated voices and distorted audio layers, reinforces the sense of unease, making viewers question the fine line between corporate illusion and reality.`,

Echoia's dynamic virtual persona is designed to overlap with a physical body, moving in a mutually mimetic manner with the digital entity. It also utilizes AI to infinitely diffuse and transform into multiple entities, generating an ever-flowing vortex that continuously connects them. By viewing this from a narrow, confined space, the work offers a more intimate experience, inviting viewers to project themselves through its reflection and contemplate their own digital self.

The sound is composed from conversations with a virtual AI that embodies Echoia's persona, translated into music.`,

    description: `Object Metamorphosis focuses on the mobility of landscapes and their transformation, exploring the relationship between the material and the virtual. Disappearing physical environments, such as glaciers in New Zealand, were documented through personal video recordings and transformed into 3D scans using Luma AI.

Through this process, material existence is digitally reconstructed, creating an intersection between reality and the virtual. However, this process questions whether digitization can fully preserve the identity of a place or inevitably leads to distortions and disconnections. Mobility extends beyond simple physical movement to the reconstruction of existence across time and space. Glaciers that once existed in a physical location are reborn in digital form within a virtual space, allowing the memories and traces of specific places to move and persist within new contexts.

The typography reflects this intention, designed in a fragmented and incomplete form. The incompleteness of the typography highlights the inevitable gaps and transformations brought about by digitization, which fails to fully capture the wholeness of a place. This work is presented in collaboration with GHTK as part of MAP 2024. MAP 2024 is an international artistic exchange project between Bremen, Germany, and Hanoi, Vietnam, with this year's theme being 'Mobility.' The project explores not only physical movement but also the spread of ideas, thoughts, languages, and artistic expressions. From December 14 to 20, posters created by Bremen artists will be attached to GHTK delivery motorbikes, traveling across Hanoi and offering a new perspective on movement.`,

    description: `Space debris, invisible to the naked eye, is an underestimated threat for many. While it may not seem urgent at present, the accumulation of space debris could result in severe environmental consequences for Earth in the future. I am deeply dedicated to exploring perspectives beyond the human gaze by blending elements of nature and technology.

Conceptually, I aimed to visually represent space debris as a vast ring encircling Earth. To effectively convey this concept, I combined auditory and visual effects to stimulate human senses of sound and sight. By utilizing these senses, I hope to elevate awareness of this issue by prompting users to vocalize the phrase 'space debris.' This innovative project unfolds as a dynamic web page set against the backdrop of space. Upon loading, the page detects the phrase 'space debris,' transforming it into a password to guide users to the next environment. Using Speech Recognition technology, users are prompted to speak the designated phrase, leading them to the final page.

The final page offers a unique experience with each visit, featuring diverse music, text, and interactive objects. Each object corresponds to distinct textual descriptions, with direct engagement revealing 3D models responsive to sound intensity. Space debris primarily comprises remnants from artificial satellites and other space objects. To enhance intrigue, I integrated commonplace items into the visual narrative. This symbolizes the omnipresence of space debris in our surroundings and underscores the inevitability of humans being part of this cycle. This phenomenon emphasizes the urgent need for heightened awareness and proactive solutions.`,
